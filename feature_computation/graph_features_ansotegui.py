Graph features from Structure features for SAT instances classification (Ansotegui)
------
The scale free structure (based on variable occurrences) (estimation computed by method of maximum likelihood)

exponent of the Power law distribution of variable occurrences
compute the function f_v(k), which is the number of variables that have a number of occurrences equal to k, divided by the number of variables n.
# Assuming that this function follows a power-law distribution (f_v(k) roughly = ck^-a_v), we can estimate the exponent a_v of the power law distribution that bes fits this collection of points.
This estimation is computed by the method of maximum likelihood

-Compute for all numbers k, f_v(k) = var(k)/n
-for this series, estimate the power law exponent with maximum likelihood (ask/research more about this), also the plfit package

alpha = 1 + n[sum(ln(x_i/x_min)]^-1
--------

Variable incidence graph (VIG)

Clause variable incidence graph (CVIG)

Methods for creating the VIG and CVIG should be alright

Then the fractal dimension of both the VIG and CVIG are calculated
by computing the function N(r) (Computing by burning node degrees approximation algorithm). 
This is an estimate of the minimum number of circles with radius r that can cover the graph.
This value is estimated by linear regression interpolating the points log N(r) vs log r, as N(r) ~ r^-d.

------
And the Modularity Q of the VIG is calculated
The modularity of a graph is the maximal modularity for any possible partition Q(C)  = max{Q(G,C) | C}
We can find this maximum partition with the community package (uses louvain method), and the result is the modularity of the best partition.
